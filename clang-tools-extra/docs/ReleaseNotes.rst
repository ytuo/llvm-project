New module
^^^^^^^^^^
- New module `llvmlibc`.

  This module contains checks related to the LLVM-libc coding standards.

New checks
^^^^^^^^^^
- New :doc:`bsl-lambda-implicit-capture
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-lambda-implicit-capture>` check.

  Check for implicit captures of variables with automatic storage duration.

- New :doc:`bsl-lambda-param-list
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-lambda-param-list>` check.

  Ensures lambda expressions' parameter lists are explicit.

- New :doc:`bsl-op-bitwise-operands
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-op-bitwise-operands>` check.

  Warns if operands to binary bitwise operations have different types.

- New :doc:`bsl-op-conditional-subexpr
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-op-conditional-subexpr>` check.

  Warns whenever a conditional operator is used as a subexpression

- New :doc:`bsl-op-equality-virt-memfn-nullptr
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-op-equality-virt-memfn-nullptr>` check.

  Warns if a pointer to virtual member function is compared for equality
  to an expression that is not 'nullptr'.

- New :doc:`bsl-op-forbidden-overload
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-op-forbidden-overload>` check.

  Warns if binary-logical, comma, subscript, or unary-ampresand operators
  are overloaded.

- New :doc:`bsl-op-mixed-increment-decrement
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-op-mixed-increment-decrement>` check.

  Warns if "++" or "--" operators are mixed with other operations.

- New :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-avoid-non-const-global-variables
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-avoid-non-const-global-variables>` check.
  Finds non-const global variables as described in check I.2 of C++ Core
  Guidelines.

- New :doc:`bsl-enum-explicit
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-enum-explicit>` check.

  Check all enum declarations explicitly state the underlying type.

- New :doc:`bsl-enum-init
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-enum-init>` check.

  Check that either none or all or the first only enum constants
  are initialized.

- New :doc:`bsl-literals-ascii-only
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-literals-ascii-only>` check.

  Ensures only ASCII-encoded string literals are used.

- New :doc:`bsl-literals-no-octal
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-literals-no-octal>` check.

  Checks that no octal integer literals nor octal escape sequences
  exist.

- New :doc:`bsl-literals-uppercase-suffix
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-literals-uppercase-suffix>` check.

  Checks that each integer literal has an uppercase integer suffix.

- New :doc:`bsl-enum-scoped
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-enum-scoped>` check.

  Check all enums are scoped.

- New :doc:`bsl-non-pod-static
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-non-pod-static>` check.

  Checks that static storage duration is not used for non-POD variables.

- New :doc:`bsl-types-fixed-width-ints
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-types-fixed-width-ints>` check.

  Checks that fixed-width integer types are used.

- New :doc:`bsl-types-no-wide-char
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-types-no-wide-char>` check.

  Check that no wide-character types are used.

- New :doc:`bsl-unused-return-value
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-unused-return-value>` check.

  Checks for unused non-void function return values.

- New :doc:`bugprone-misplaced-pointer-arithmetic-in-alloc
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-misplaced-pointer-arithmetic-in-alloc>` check.

  Finds cases where an integer expression is added to or subtracted from the
  result of a memory allocation function (``malloc()``, ``calloc()``,
  ``realloc()``, ``alloca()``) instead of its argument.

- New :doc:`bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions>` check.

  Finds ``cnd_wait``, ``cnd_timedwait``, ``wait``, ``wait_for``, or
  ``wait_until`` function calls when the function is not invoked from a loop
  that checks whether a condition predicate holds or the function has a
  condition parameter.

- New :doc:`bugprone-reserved-identifier
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-reserved-identifier>` check.

  Checks for usages of identifiers reserved for use by the implementation.

- New :doc:`bugprone-suspicious-include
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-suspicious-include>` check.

  Finds cases where an include refers to what appears to be an implementation
  file, which often leads to hard-to-track-down ODR violations, and diagnoses
  them.

- New :doc:`cert-oop57-cpp
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-oop57-cpp>` check.

  Flags use of the `C` standard library functions ``memset``, ``memcpy`` and
  ``memcmp`` and similar derivatives on non-trivial types.

- New :doc:`llvmlibc-restrict-system-libc-headers
  <clang-tidy/checks/llvmlibc-restrict-system-libc-headers>` check.

  Finds includes of system libc headers not provided by the compiler within
  llvm-libc implementations.

- New :doc:`objc-dealloc-in-category
  <clang-tidy/checks/objc-dealloc-in-category>` check.

  Finds implementations of -dealloc in Objective-C categories.

- New :doc:`misc-no-recursion
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc-no-recursion>` check.

  Finds recursive functions and diagnoses them.

New check aliases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- New alias :doc:`cert-con36-c
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-con36-c>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions>` was added.

- New alias :doc:`cert-con54-cpp
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-con54-cpp>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions>` was added.

- New alias :doc:`cert-dcl37-c
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-dcl37-c>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-reserved-identifier
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-reserved-identifier>` was added.

- New alias :doc:`cert-dcl51-cpp
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-dcl51-cpp>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-reserved-identifier
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-reserved-identifier>` was added.

Changes in existing checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Improved :doc:`readability-qualified-auto
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-qualified-auto>` check now supports a
  `AddConstToQualified` to enable adding ``const`` qualifiers to variables
  typed with ``auto *`` and ``auto &``.

- Improved :doc:`readability-redundant-string-init
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-redundant-string-init>` check now supports a
  `StringNames` option enabling its application to custom string classes. The
  check now detects in class initializers and constructor initializers which
  are deemed to be redundant.

- Checks supporting the ``HeaderFileExtensions`` flag now support ``;`` as a
  delimiter in addition to ``,``, with the latter being deprecated as of this
  release. This simplifies how one specifies the options on the command line:
  ``--config="{CheckOptions: [{ key: HeaderFileExtensions, value: h;;hpp;hxx }]}"``

Renamed checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The 'fuchsia-restrict-system-headers' check was renamed to :doc:`portability-restrict-system-includes
  <clang-tidy/checks/portability-restrict-system-includes>`
