New module
^^^^^^^^^^
- New module `llvmlibc`.

  This module contains checks related to the LLVM-libc coding standards.

New checks
^^^^^^^^^^
- New :doc:`bsl-assign-op-decl-ref-qualifier
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-assign-op-decl-ref-qualifier>` check.

  Checks that assignment operators are declared with the ref-qualifier &.

- New :doc:`bsl-auto-type-usage
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-auto-type-usage>` check.

  Checks that the auto specifier is only used
    1. to declare that a variable has the same type as return type of a function call
    2. to declare that a variable has the same type as initializer of non-fundamental
      (non-literal) type
    3. to declare parameters of a generic lambda expression
    4. to declare a function (template) using trailing return type syntax.

- New :doc:`bsl-boolean-operators-forbidden
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-boolean-operators-forbidden>` check.

  Warns if you use && or ||.

- New :doc:`bsl-class-base
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-class-base>` check.

  Warns if a class derives from more than one non-interface base class.

- New :doc:`bsl-class-final-function
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-class-final-function>` check.

  Warns if a non-overridden virtual function is declared in final class and
  warns if an overridden function is not marked final in a final class.

- New :doc:`bsl-class-member-init
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-class-member-init>` check.

  Warns in any of the following cases:
    1. class has fields that use a mixture of in-class initializers
      and constructor initializers
    2. constructor doesn't init each field with member initialization list
      (unless they are initialized in-class)

- New :doc:`bsl-class-member-redefined
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-class-member-redefined>` check.

  Warns if a derived class defines a data member or method that hides
  a member with the same name in one of its base classes.

- New :doc:`bsl-class-virtual-base
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-class-virtual-base>` check.

  Warns if a class has any virtual bases.

- New :doc:`bsl-comparison-operators-forbidden
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-comparison-operators-forbidden>` check.

  Warns if you use >= or <=

- New :doc:`bsl-copy-move-access-specifier
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-copy-move-access-specifier>` check.

  Checks that copy and move constructors and copy assignment and move
  assignment operators are declared protected or deleted in base class.

- New :doc:`bsl-const-obj-std-move
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-const-obj-std-move>` check.

  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-else-required-after-if>` check.

  Warns if else/bsl::touch is missing in certain situations. This will also
  warn if else is used when it shouldn't be, which would prevent the above
  checks from working correctly.

- New :doc:`bsl-function-name-use
  <clang-tidy/checks/bsl-function-name-use>` check.

  Warns if a function name is used in an expression other than a call

New check aliases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- New alias :doc:`cert-con36-c
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-con36-c>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions>` was added.

- New alias :doc:`cert-con54-cpp
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-con54-cpp>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions>` was added.

- New alias :doc:`cert-dcl37-c
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-dcl37-c>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-reserved-identifier
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-reserved-identifier>` was added.

- New alias :doc:`cert-dcl51-cpp
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-dcl51-cpp>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-reserved-identifier
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-reserved-identifier>` was added.

Changes in existing checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Improved :doc:`readability-qualified-auto
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-qualified-auto>` check now supports a
  `AddConstToQualified` to enable adding ``const`` qualifiers to variables
  typed with ``auto *`` and ``auto &``.

- Improved :doc:`readability-redundant-string-init
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-redundant-string-init>` check now supports a
  `StringNames` option enabling its application to custom string classes. The
  check now detects in class initializers and constructor initializers which
  are deemed to be redundant.

- Checks supporting the ``HeaderFileExtensions`` flag now support ``;`` as a
  delimiter in addition to ``,``, with the latter being deprecated as of this
  release. This simplifies how one specifies the options on the command line:
  ``--config="{CheckOptions: [{ key: HeaderFileExtensions, value: h;;hpp;hxx }]}"``

Renamed checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The 'fuchsia-restrict-system-headers' check was renamed to :doc:`portability-restrict-system-includes
  <clang-tidy/checks/portability-restrict-system-includes>`
