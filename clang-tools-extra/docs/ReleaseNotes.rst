New check aliases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- New alias :doc:`cert-con36-c
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-con36-c>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions>` was added.

- New alias :doc:`cert-con54-cpp
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-con54-cpp>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-spuriously-wake-up-functions>` was added.

- New alias :doc:`cert-dcl37-c
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-dcl37-c>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-reserved-identifier
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-reserved-identifier>` was added.

- New alias :doc:`cert-dcl51-cpp
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-dcl51-cpp>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-reserved-identifier
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-reserved-identifier>` was added.

Changes in existing checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Improved :doc:`readability-qualified-auto
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-qualified-auto>` check now supports a
  `AddConstToQualified` to enable adding ``const`` qualifiers to variables
  typed with ``auto *`` and ``auto &``.

- Improved :doc:`readability-redundant-string-init
  <clang-tidy/checks/readability-redundant-string-init>` check now supports a
  `StringNames` option enabling its application to custom string classes. The
  check now detects in class initializers and constructor initializers which
  are deemed to be redundant.

- Checks supporting the ``HeaderFileExtensions`` flag now support ``;`` as a
  delimiter in addition to ``,``, with the latter being deprecated as of this
  release. This simplifies how one specifies the options on the command line:
  ``--config="{CheckOptions: [{ key: HeaderFileExtensions, value: h;;hpp;hxx }]}"``

Renamed checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The 'fuchsia-restrict-system-headers' check was renamed to :doc:`portability-restrict-system-includes
  <clang-tidy/checks/portability-restrict-system-includes>`
